#### Enigma

###### Functionality;
3, Both my encrypt and decrypt have been implemented on CLI. I have not attempted cracking method so can not be considered for a 4.

###### OOP;
2.5, The majority of the project meets expectations, however im not 100% the superclass is being used correctly. Code and decode should also potentially be moved to individual classes.

###### Ruby conventions and mechanics;
3, Code is properly indented, and ive used multiple hashes. In using a Hash and i believe correctly this means im above below expectations. I have 2 methds which are over 10 lines which also means it cannot be above expectaitions.

###### TDD;
3, I wrote tests first and have made sure unit test are written when needed. Simplecov showing as 100% coverage. No mocks/stubs used so cant be considered for 4.

###### Version control;
3, Above 40 commits and 11 pull requests, i do think some commits and pull requests could of been clearer as to purpose/changes. Possible multi functionality early on doing small methods/tests.
